The town didn't have much in the way of decoration because the people were far more pragmatic than that. They would much rather spend their time and effort clearing the forest or building a new building than celebrating some far of king or religious icon. It only had a single public statue. The statue was old - so old that most people didn't know who it was supposed to represent. Some people thought it was a local prophet who had predicted great feats, while others said it was a general who enacted feats through his iron will.
