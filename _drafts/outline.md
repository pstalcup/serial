# Characters

## Eliza

20. A girl who lives on a backwater island (Maheun). She is the only daughter of small sustenance farmers who don't want to force her into marriage (which is traditional for girls her age). She meets Dominic one night while exploring ancient parts of her island. He ends up exposing her underground research (which is considered taboo), forcing her to flee the island or be married to the police chief. After leaving the island, she Dominic and Francis travel to another island 

## Isaac

24. Grandson of a disgraced general, son of a war hero/martyr. Attending a military academy on Heun. After receiving an ancient book from his Grandfather about the Cataclysm (a moment when all islands are aligned in a particular way), he travels to Seoreundul to try to gain the power that will be gushed forth.  

## Dominic

22. Child genius from the ancient civilization on Yesunnet which disappeared during the last Cataclysm. He was leading his country on slaying the beetles called "God" to gain the magic contained within. As they began to kill the beetles, though, magic started to fade from their land, so they began to attack other islands to gain more magic. They attempted to control the Cataclysm to feed their addiciton to magic, but it ended up destroying not only the people on the island, but also the entire island itself. He ends up joining with Isaac, who Eliza determines is evil. Eliza then leaves them and tries to stop them from destroying the Hana like they did Yesunnet. 


## Francis

24. Deputy in the police. Grew up Maheun with Eliza, and let her break into sacred buildings at night to study about the rotations of the islands. Is kicked out from the police force when it comes out that he let her into the research buildings. Travels with Eliza and Dominic, and ends up falling in love with Dominic. He betrays Eliza to Dominic, and joins him and Isaac in attempting to harness the Cataclysm. 

## Charles

One of Dominic's teachers. Advocated instead of killing God that they should keep them as pets and learn to channel their magic. Is stuck in time with Dominic, but ends up coming out slightly earlier. Gives Eliza her notebook, and learns their language. Joins Eliza in trying to stop Isaac and Dominic from harnessing the cataclysm. 

# Places

Each Island is numbered in Korean (because I wanted to pick a numbering system that would be nonobvious to English Readers)

## Hana

Where Isaac and his Grandfather live. One of the 8 biggest Islands

## Maheun

Where Eliza and Francis live, where Dominic and Charles are trapped in time for 1024 years.

## Yesunnet (Destroyed)

Where Dominic and Charles are from. Disappeared 1024 years ago during the last cataclysm. 

## Seoreundul 

The island where the cataclysm will take place - where Isaac, Dominic, Charles are all headed. 

# Concepts

## God

A bunch of beetles, all of which come out of the ground on different years. In Dominic's time they are slain for their magic, which causes the islands to slow down. Dominic has learned to kill them and use their remains for various magical artifacts (time control, combat, etc.)
Charles, on the other hand, has learned to keep some as pets, which enhance his natural ability. 

## Island movement

Every year, each island moves to a new location. There are 1024 different configurations of the 64 islands (in Eliza's time, they call them the 63, as the 64th island has been destroyed and is a moving reef). Every 64 configurations a small amount of magic is released on a different island. On the final configuration, large excesses of magic are released from the 32nd island. Releases of magic are tied to propserity of the island it is released on. The magic from the Cataclysm is important to movement of the island as a whole.

Islands that are drained of their magic slow down. The 64th island was destroyed because it channeled too much of the magic and couldn't contain it. Isaac and Dominic have a better system to contain the magic, but removing the magic from the island system (as opposed to letting it rejoin it as would naturally happen at the cataclysm) could stop movement on the entire island, ending life as they know it and destroying significant amounts of islands.
