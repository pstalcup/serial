title: Introduction

I've always wanted to be a writer, as long as I have been a reader. I've tried all sorts of things, be it flash fiction or full length novels, and have yet to be as successful as I would like. 

This year, I am going to try something a little different. I am going to write serialized fiction, each week publishing a new part in an ongoing story. I have already planned out the story (for the most part), so it comes down to the simple act of writing. 

If you're reading this, I hope you enjoy the effort I've put forth.
